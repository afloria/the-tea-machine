# the-tea-machine
This project is a tea machine simulator. The machine will supply various items needed to make a cup of tea: water, tea leaves, honey, and disposable cups. The tea machine will allow you to choose either a cup of unsweetened matcha tea, earl grey tea, or chamomile tea. This machine will also collect payment for each cup of tea.
